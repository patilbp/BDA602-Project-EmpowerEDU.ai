## Project Overview:
Education 2.0 is derived from Web 2.0, which transitions from traditional instructional learning to more dynamic, student-centered, and technology-driven learning. It emphasizes three Cs: communicating, contributing, and collaborating. However, it never addresses how to support the teachers in transition which leads to teacher burnout. This project proposes EmpowerEDU.ai platform to utilize artificial intelligence for teaching. It mainly focuses on three areas:

1. Lesson planning assists in scaffolding and differentiation.
2. Grading gives the student instant and authentic feedback.
3. Personalized learning utilizes gamification to collect the student data for teaching.

EmpowerEDU.ai acts as the virtual teaching assistant to reduce the heavy workload and revolutionize education.
